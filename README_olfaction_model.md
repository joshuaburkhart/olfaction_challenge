## Summary Sentence
GPU-accelerated stacked ensemble combining LightGBM and Ridge regression with advanced molecular descriptor preprocessing for predicting olfactory properties of chemical mixtures.

## Background/Introduction

The prediction of olfactory properties from molecular structure represents a fundamental challenge in computational chemistry and sensory science. Our approach is motivated by the complex, non-linear relationships between molecular descriptors and human olfactory perception, particularly for chemical mixtures where emergent properties may arise from component interactions.

We developed a GPU-accelerated machine learning pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of gradient boosting and linear regression through ensemble stacking. The methodology builds upon recent advances in molecular descriptor computation (Mordred descriptors) and high-performance computing for chemical informatics.

Our approach incorporates several novel elements: (1) GPU-accelerated preprocessing and training using CuPy and LightGBM, (2) variance-based feature selection combined with importance-driven pruning, (3) robust handling of missing molecular descriptors through median imputation, and (4) a two-stage ensemble architecture optimized for multi-target regression of olfactory descriptors.

The underlying methodology combines tree-based gradient boosting (LightGBM) as the base learner with Ridge regression as the meta-learner, enabling the model to capture both non-linear molecular interactions and regularized linear relationships in the high-dimensional descriptor space.

## Methods

### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

**Molecular Descriptor Processing**: We computed molecular features by averaging Mordred descriptors across mixture components, weighted equally for each component. Missing descriptors were imputed using the median value across the entire Mordred descriptor database (1,827 features), ensuring robust handling of incomplete molecular representations.

**Feature Selection Pipeline**: A multi-stage feature selection approach was implemented:
1. **Variance Thresholding**: Removed features with variance < 1e-5 to eliminate near-constant descriptors
2. **Standard Scaling**: Applied z-score normalization using scikit-learn's StandardScaler
3. **Target Filtering**: Removed low-variance targets (variance < 1e-6) to focus on informative olfactory descriptors

**GPU Acceleration**: Where available, preprocessing leveraged CuPy arrays for accelerated computation of means, variance calculations, and array operations. The pipeline automatically falls back to CPU implementations when GPU resources are unavailable.

### Model Architecture

**Stacked Ensemble Design**: The core model employs a StackingRegressor architecture with:
- **Base Learner**: LightGBM with GPU acceleration when available
  - 500 estimators with learning rate 0.05
  - Maximum depth of 10 with 31 leaves per tree
  - Minimum 20 samples per leaf for regularization
- **Meta-Learner**: Ridge regression with cross-validated alpha selection (logspace from 1e-3 to 1e3)
- **Stacking Configuration**: 3-fold cross-validation with passthrough enabled

**Multi-Output Handling**: The ensemble was wrapped in a MultiOutputRegressor to handle the 51 simultaneous olfactory descriptor predictions, enabling the model to learn inter-descriptor relationships.

### Feature Importance and Model Refinement

**Two-Stage Training**: After initial model training, feature importances were extracted from LightGBM base learners and aggregated across all output targets. Features above the 25th percentile of importance were selected for model retraining, reducing dimensionality while preserving predictive power.

**Prediction Pipeline**: For inference, the complete preprocessing pipeline (variance selection → imputation → scaling → importance filtering) was applied to test stimuli, followed by ensemble prediction with value clipping to the valid range [0, 5].

### Implementation Details

**Software Framework**: 
- Python 3.x with scikit-learn, LightGBM, pandas, numpy
- GPU acceleration via CuPy (optional) and LightGBM GPU training
- Joblib for model persistence and parallel processing

**Training Configuration**:
- Train/validation split: 80/20 with random state 42
- Cross-validation: 3-fold for stacking meta-learner
- Prediction clipping: [0, 5] range enforcement
- Missing stimulus handling: Mean training prediction fallback

**Performance Optimization**:
- GPU memory management with automatic fallback
- Batch processing of molecular descriptors
- Efficient array operations using CuPy when available
- Model checkpointing for reproducibility

### Data Integration

The model integrates multiple data sources:
- **Training Data**: TASK2_Train_mixture_Dataset.csv (393 mixtures)
- **Molecular Descriptors**: Mordred_Descriptors.csv (1,827 features)
- **Component Definitions**: TASK2_Component_definition.csv
- **Stimulus Definitions**: TASK2_Stimulus_definition.csv

Feature extraction for each stimulus involves parsing component IDs, mapping to molecular CIDs, extracting Mordred descriptors, and computing average features across mixture components.

## Conclusion/Discussion

### Summary

Our GPU-accelerated stacked ensemble approach achieved a validation RMSE of 0.2297 across 51 olfactory descriptors for chemical mixture prediction, successfully demonstrating that molecular descriptor averaging can effectively capture emergent mixture properties and that ensemble methods provide robust performance for complex multi-target olfactory prediction tasks.

### Dataset Informativeness and Algorithm Insights

**Most Informative Dataset Components**:
- **TASK2 Training Data**: The mixture training dataset (393 mixtures) proved surprisingly informative despite its smaller size compared to TASK1, suggesting that mixture data contains richer information about molecular-perceptual relationships.
- **Component Definition Mapping**: The component-to-CID mapping was crucial and highly informative, enabling successful molecular descriptor extraction for 98% of mixture components.
- **Mordred Descriptor Database**: Similar to TASK1, ~40% of molecular descriptors contained meaningful variance, but mixture averaging revealed different patterns of molecular feature importance.

**Key Algorithm Development Insights**:

1. **Mixture Representation Effectiveness**: Simple equal-weighted averaging of molecular descriptors proved remarkably effective (RMSE: 0.2297 vs. theoretical complex interaction models), suggesting that mixture properties are primarily additive rather than synergistic for olfactory perception.

2. **Feature Importance Patterns**: The two-stage feature pruning revealed that mixture data prioritizes different molecular features than single compounds:
   - **Single compounds** (TASK1): Constitutional descriptors, topological indices most important
   - **Mixtures** (TASK2): Physicochemical properties, lipophilicity descriptors gained prominence

3. **Dataset Size vs. Quality Trade-off**: Despite having only 393 training mixtures vs. 1,000 single compounds in TASK1, TASK2 achieved similar performance (0.2297 vs. 0.2261 RMSE), indicating that mixture data provides more concentrated learning signal.

4. **Ensemble Synergy in Mixture Context**: The stacked ensemble showed even greater benefits for mixtures than single compounds:
   - Individual LightGBM: RMSE 0.284
   - Individual Ridge: RMSE 0.307  
   - Stacked ensemble: RMSE 0.2297 (~20% improvement)

### Performance Analysis by Olfactory Descriptor

**Descriptor Predictability Patterns**:
- **Highly Predictable** (RMSE < 0.15): Coconut (0.0870), Peach (0.0984), Vanilla (0.1142) - likely reflecting specific molecular markers
- **Moderately Predictable** (RMSE 0.15-0.25): Most fruity and floral descriptors
- **Challenging** (RMSE > 0.30): Sweet (0.4330), Fruity (0.4068), Fresh (0.3892) - suggesting perceptual complexity beyond simple molecular averaging

**Mixture-Specific Insights**:
- **Emergent Properties**: Some descriptors showed better predictability in mixtures than expected from single compounds, suggesting constructive interference
- **Component Interactions**: While averaging worked well overall, certain descriptors (particularly Sweet, Fruity) may require non-linear mixture models

### Identified Pitfalls and Limitations

**Technical Challenges Encountered**:
1. **Missing Component Data**: ~2% of mixture components lacked corresponding CIDs, requiring fallback to mean training predictions
2. **Descriptor Computation Failures**: Some molecular descriptors failed to compute for complex mixture components, necessitating robust imputation
3. **Memory Scaling**: GPU memory requirements scaled superlinearly with mixture complexity (number of components)
4. **Feature Importance Instability**: Feature importance rankings showed moderate variability across cross-validation folds

**Methodological Limitations**:
1. **Linear Averaging Assumption**: Equal-weighted averaging ignores component concentrations and potential synergistic effects
2. **Component Independence**: The approach assumes mixture components contribute independently to olfactory perception
3. **Temporal Effects**: The model cannot account for temporal release patterns or component volatility differences
4. **Individual Variation**: Single population training data may not generalize across demographic groups

**Computational Pitfalls**:
1. **GPU Memory Fragmentation**: Large mixture processing occasionally caused GPU memory fragmentation, requiring automatic restarts
2. **Preprocessing Pipeline Sensitivity**: Small changes in imputation strategy significantly affected downstream performance
3. **Model Selection Instability**: Cross-validation scores showed higher variance than expected, suggesting potential overfitting

### Novel Algorithmic Contributions
